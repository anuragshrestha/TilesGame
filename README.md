# This is my TilesGame project

## Introduction

This is a Popular NY Times Tiles Game that represents different 
size of rectangular shapes and unique colors on each box. We will
need to click on two different boxes and the colors that are
common between them will be removed and the current streaks will
be increase each time. When all the rectangle boxes is removed then
the game will be over.


## How to play the Game

1. When we start playing the game, we need to click any of the rectangle
   boxes and then click or choose another rectangle box. If any color
   is shared between those boxes or if those two boxes has same colors
   then those colors will be removed and the current streaks will be
   incremented by one. 
2. The second selected tile will become the current or first tile. 
3. Then the player will need to choose again 
   the second tile and the game goes on like this until all the 
   rectangle boxes are removed. 
4. But if the selected two tiles does not share common colors then the 
   streaks will be reset to zero while the longest streaks will be stored. 
5. When the player ends on an empty tile, then they can start again from 
   any tile without losing their current streaks.
6. When the Game is over, it shows a Alert Information box that indicates
   the game is over.
