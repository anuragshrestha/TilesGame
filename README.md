# This is my TilesGame project

## Introduction

This is a Popular NY Times Tiles Game that represents different 
size of rectangular shapes and unique colors on each box. We will
need to click on two different boxes and the colors that are
common between them will be removed and the current streaks will
be increase each time. When all the rectangle boxes is removed then
the game will be over.
